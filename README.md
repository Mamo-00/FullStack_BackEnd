# FullStackTutorialApp

This is the back end development of a website that documents the departments at its respective employees in a company. This Code is written by following a tutorial made by the Youtube channel "Art of Engineer" and the video is called "React JS + .NET Core Web API + Microsoft SQL | full stack app tutorial" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-Z1iD6Y-c).

The project is written is Visual Studio and is a .Net Core Web API project. The data is stored in SQL server and I used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to interact with the data and created APIs to do the CRUD operations on the data.

There is a front end repository for this website with the name FullStack_FrontEnd_App if you want to check it out.
